Enterprise OS Dashboard (Company OS / Business OS) — Project Definition + Scalable Plan
1) Vision / One‑liner
Build a modern, user-friendly “Enterprise OS” dashboard: a single extensible platform that unifies identity, operations, analytics, documentation, security controls, and third‑party integrations into one cohesive “control plane” for the company.
This becomes both:

An internal operating layer (how your org runs day-to-day), and
A productized SaaS/PaaS you can sell to others.


2) Core Goals (Non‑Negotiables)

Single pane of glass for business + IT + security operations
SSO-first identity using Microsoft Entra ID via OIDC/OAuth, so you don’t manage password files yourself [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
Integration hub for third-party APIs + internal micro apps/widgets (fast to add more later)
Security-native platform: RBAC/ACL governance, audit trails, and a clear path to Zero Trust
SaaS/PaaS readiness: multi-tenant design + scalable data foundation (DB → lakehouse/data lake)
Hybrid-first reality: support cloud + on-prem/local hosting + edge devices (physical security, NVRs, etc.)
Modern UX: clean, “premium” enterprise UI with fast navigation, role-based views, and composable widgets


3) Target Users / Personas (Who it serves)

Exec / Owner view: company health, KPIs, risk posture, revenue/ops dashboards
Ops / Admin: user lifecycle, access controls, workflows, incidents, system status
Business teams: CRM, SEO, documentation, reporting, operational tooling
Security / IT: identity posture, access reviews, physical + digital security controls, NVR alerts


4) Product Scope (What it is)
A) Identity & Access (Foundation Layer)

Microsoft Entra ID SSO using OpenID Connect flows (Entra authenticates; your platform consumes tokens) [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
RBAC + ACLs mapped to Entra groups/users (Finance / IT / Security / Exec, etc.)
Provisioning & lifecycle hooks: account creation, deprovisioning, access approvals, entitlement changes (where possible tied to Entra governance)

Security best-practice alignment: enforce least privilege and minimize broad admin roles; Microsoft explicitly recommends granting only what users need and using narrow scopes where possible. [learn.microsoft.com]

B) “OS Dashboard” User Experience (Modern + Friendly)

A customizable “desktop” style home page with widgets / micro-apps:

drag/drop layouts
role-based default dashboards
pinned modules + personalized quick actions


A consistent interaction model:
Search → Actions → Insights

Search finds anything (docs, customers, devices, alerts, jobs)
Actions run workflows (create account, provision access, open incident)
Insights show dashboards/graphs/health states




C) Integrations & API Hub (Connector Framework)
Design an integration architecture that makes it easy to add new connectors later without redesigning the platform.
Connector framework supports:

OAuth/OIDC connectors (cloud apps)
API key connectors
Webhooks / event ingestion
Polling + caching (rate-limit friendly)
Normalized data model so widgets are reusable (connectors map data → canonical objects)


For SaaS scaling, it’s common to hide “tenant context” and multi-tenant policies inside shared libraries/modules so product teams don’t rewrite tenancy logic in every service. AWS explicitly describes this approach for multi-tenant microservices. [docs.aws.amazon.com]


D) Security & Zero Trust (Built In, Not Bolted On)
Treat this product as a control plane that can enforce Zero Trust decisions rather than merely displaying dashboards.
Zero Trust direction:

Identity-centric boundaries (Entra-based auth is the first gate) [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
Least privilege (RBAC/ABAC hybrid for fine-grained control)
“Policy decision” and “policy enforcement” separation: enforce at gateways and services
Continuous signals (device/network posture, login anomalies, physical events) feed policy decisions

Concrete access control option:

A hybrid RBAC + ABAC model for multi-tenant authorization (tenant context + attributes like “uses_mfa”) is a known best-practice pattern in multi-tenant SaaS authorization examples. [docs.aws.amazon.com]


E) Data Platform (DBs → Lakehouse / Data Lakes)
You explicitly want multiple databases and growth into data lakes.
Plan for:

Product DB (tenants, users, roles, configs, widget layouts)
Integration store:

Raw ingestion tables (audit-friendly, replayable)
Normalized entities (customers/jobs/assets/events)


Analytics layer → evolves into data lakes/lakehouse across Azure + Google Cloud


F) Physical + Digital Security Controls (Unified)
You want the OS to govern both:

Digital controls: accounts, groups, ACLs, entitlements, policies
Physical controls: RADIUS integration (or similar) to tie identity to physical systems (doors, network auth, etc.)

Additionally:

Integrate NVRs and surveillance events into “Security Ops”
Tie account creation + access policy into Entra group membership and internal policy engine


G) Video / NVR & Security Operations
You mentioned forking Frigate or using APIs. Frigate supports MQTT and documents the topic structure and frigate/events stream—ideal for event ingestion (alerts, correlations, health). [grindsuccess.com]
For scaling, you can bridge MQTT → webhook/event bus; MQTT→webhook is a common pattern for pushing IoT-style events into downstream systems. [emqx.com], [github.com]

5) Required Integrations (Current List — Kept Intact)
SEO

Google Ads (planned)
Google Analytics (planned)
Google Search Console (API supported) [discourse....odered.org]
Ahrefs (API supported; current docs reference API v3 / programs) [merriam-webster.com], [relatedwords.io]

Networking

pfSense → community REST/GraphQL API package exists [linkedin.com]
OPNsense → official API structure documented [bestnamege...rators.com]
UniFi / Ubiquiti → official UniFi API guidance exists; site manager + local APIs [markus.bot]

CRM / Field Service (open to building your own later)

ServiceFusion → published API docs with base URI and resources (customers/jobs/estimates/invoices/etc.) [quizlet.com]

Cloud

Azure
Google Cloud

Local Hosting / Edge

Cloudflare
Proxmox
Local reverse proxy / “control plane” integration

Security / Physical

Entra-based lifecycle + ACLs
RADIUS integration for physical controls
NVR ingest (Frigate events via MQTT) [grindsuccess.com]


6) Architecture (Scalable, Service-Based, Docker, Hybrid)
A) Service Decomposition (Microservices-first, but pragmatic)
You said: break down as different services, use Docker, hybrid cloud, multiple DBs, API gateways.
A clean, scalable breakdown:
1) Frontend UI

Widget framework (micro-frontends optional)
Role-based dashboard layouts
Search and command palette UX

2) Identity & Access Service

Entra OIDC integration [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
RBAC/ABAC authorization decisions
Tenant context resolution
Audit of access decisions

3) Policy Engine

Central policy evaluation (RBAC/ABAC)
Policy versioning (treat policy like code)
“Decision point” that other services call

4) API Gateway

Single entry point for UI + external API consumers
JWT/OIDC validation, rate limits, routing, observability
This matches standard API gateway responsibilities: routing/auth/rate limiting/logging at the edge [calmops.com], [teachmeidea.com]

5) Connector Services (by domain)

SEO connectors (GSC, Ahrefs, Ads, Analytics)
Network connectors (UniFi, OPNsense, pfSense)
CRM connectors (ServiceFusion)
Cloud connectors (Azure/GCP)
Security connectors (Frigate MQTT ingest, RADIUS bridge)

6) Data Services

Product DB service
Integration storage service
Analytics pipeline service (later data lake/lakehouse)

7) Event Bus / Ingestion

Webhooks
MQTT ingestion for Frigate and physical/IoT events [grindsuccess.com]
Convert/route events to internal systems (MQTT→webhook patterns exist) [emqx.com], [github.com]

B) Deployment Model (Hybrid + Cloud)

Local/on-prem services in Docker for edge controls (NVR, RADIUS integration points)
Cloud-hosted control plane for SaaS
Support “hybrid SaaS deployment” posture (edge nodes publish to central control plane)

C) Multi-Tenant Design Principles

Tenant context extracted early (gateway + identity service)
Tenant-specific policies applied via shared libraries/modules (recommended pattern) [docs.aws.amazon.com]
Tenant isolation in data layer (schema/row-level/DB-per-tenant depending on tier)


7) “Company OS” Modules (Top-Level Navigation)

Home (Company Health)
KPIs, alerts, risk posture, operational scorecards
Identity & Access
Users, roles, groups, entitlements, audit trails
Operations Hub
Tasks, workflows, approvals, micro apps

Password Safe (future)
Vault integration (or internal) + access control
Analytics / BI
Dashboards, graphs, SEO performance, ops metrics
Security Center
Zero Trust controls, identity posture signals, physical/digital controls
Network & Infrastructure
pfSense/OPNsense/UniFi status, cloud status, proxmox/local hosting overview
Video / NVR

8) Roadmap (MVP → V2) — Keep it Lean but Scalable
MVP (Prove the Platform)

Entra SSO + RBAC baseline [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
Widget framework (3–6 polished widgets)
Connector framework + 3 hero integrations:

ServiceFusion (jobs/customers) [quizlet.com]
UniFi site/device health [markus.bot]
Google Search Console search analytics summary [discourse....odered.org]


Audit log + admin console
Dockerized local dev + “edge agent” placeholder (even if not used yet)

V2 (Becomes True Enterprise OS)

Password safe / secret management module
Zero Trust posture + conditional workflows
Data lake pipeline + analytics model (Azure + GCP)
Frigate event ingestion + incident timeline [grindsuccess.com], [emqx.com]
pfSense/OPNsense deeper control surfaces [linkedin.com], [bestnamege...rators.com]
RADIUS bridge to physical controls


9) Action Plan That Scales (Practical Build Sequence)
Phase 0 — Foundations (Architecture & Standards)

Define canonical data model (User, Tenant, Asset, Event, Job, Customer, Metric)
Define connector interface standard (auth, sync, webhook, rate limits, caching)
Define policy model (RBAC now, ABAC hooks ready) [docs.aws.amazon.com]
Decide service boundaries + internal API contracts
Pick API gateway approach and cross-cutting requirements (auth/routing/observability) [calmops.com], [teachmeidea.com]

Phase 1 — Identity + UI Shell

Entra OIDC sign-in working end-to-end [procept-bi...botics.com], [learn.microsoft.com]
Tenant + role mapping from Entra groups
Admin console: users/roles/audit log
Dashboard shell + widget framework + navigation + search

Phase 2 — Connector Framework + First Integrations

Build connector runtime: polling, caching, token storage, webhook ingestion
Implement the first 3 hero integrations (ServiceFusion, UniFi, GSC) [quizlet.com], [markus.bot], [discourse....odered.org]
Normalize into canonical entities so widgets are reusable

Phase 3 — Security + Event Ingestion

Add event bus (webhooks + MQTT ingest)
Start with Frigate MQTT events [grindsuccess.com]
Wire in alerting + incident timeline UX
Start Zero Trust posture features as dashboards + policy checks (PDP/PEP approach)

Phase 4 — Hybrid + SaaS Packaging

Package as multi-tenant SaaS (tenant onboarding, isolation, billing hooks)
Add edge/local components (RADIUS, local proxies, NVR integrations)
Expand integrations catalog steadily


10) Design Requirements (Modern, Premium, Fast)

Beautiful modern UI (dark/light, responsive, accessible)
Fast search + command palette
Clear “status-at-a-glance” patterns (health indicators, risk indicators)
Widget marketplace UX (internal and later third-party)


11) Summary (What you’re building)
You’re not building “just a dashboard.”
You’re building a company control plane:

Identity-driven (Entra) [procept-bi...botics.com]
Integration-native (connectors)
Security-first (RBAC/ABAC + audit + Zero Trust path) [learn.microsoft.com], [docs.aws.amazon.com]
Event-aware (webhooks + MQTT for NVR/security telemetry) [grindsuccess.com], [emqx.com]
Productizable (multi-tenant SaaS/PaaS)
