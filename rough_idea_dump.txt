Enterprise OS Dashboard – Vision & Comprehensive
Implementation Plan
Executive Summary: Vision & Overarching Goals
**Vision:** Build a **modern “Enterprise OS” dashboard** – a **unified, extensible platform**
that serves as a **single pane of glass** for all critical business, IT, and security operations.
This platform functions as an internal **control plane** for the organization’s day-to-day
operations and is designed to be productized as a **scalable SaaS/PaaS** offering for
external customers. It centralizes multiple tools and systems into one **cohesive, user-friendly
dashboard**, integrating identity management, operational workflows, analytics,
documentation, security controls, and thirdnparty services. The end goal is a comprehensive
**“Company Operating System”** that increases visibility and efficiency, enforces strong
security by design, and serves as a foundation for both internal use and a potential
revenue-generating product.
**Unified Control Plane for the Enterprise:** Provides a **single, unified interface** for
business, IT, and security operations – consolidating identity management, operations,
analytics, documentation, and more into one seamless platform, eliminating siloed tools and
fragmented workflows.
**SSO-First, Identity-Centric Security:** Integrates Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) Single
Sign-On via OpenID Connect (OIDC) to streamline authentication. This ensures users sign in
with corporate credentials, and the app consumes standard OIDC tokens, eliminating the
need to manage separate passwords. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) aligned with
least-privilege principles (granting only necessary access at narrow scopes) is built in from
day one.
**Integration Hub & Extensibility:** Features a flexible connector framework for rapid
integration of third-party APIs and internal micro-apps. The platform will support connectors
for cloud services, networking equipment, security systems, and more – enabling a **holistic
view** of enterprise systems. A *canonical data model* allows unified widgets and analytics
across diverse data sources.
**Security-First & Zero Trust Aligned:** Designed with security as a core tenet, the platform
implements fine-grained access controls (RBAC with future support for ABAC), audit logging,
and embraces Zero Trust principles – verifying identity, device, and context for each action.
Both digital and physical security controls (e.g. network access via RADIUS, camera/NVR
monitoring) are unified under the same identity-driven policies.
**SaaS-Ready & Scalable Architecture:** Built as a cloud-native, microservices-based
application using Docker containers for portability and scalability. Multi-tenant design is baked
in, with strict tenant isolation and context handled by shared libraries. The architecture
supports hybrid deployments (cloud plus on-premise components) and is ready to scale into
data lake and analytics use cases as the organization grows.
Core Objectives (NonnNegotiable Goals)
1. **Single Pane of Glass for Operations:** Provide one **central dashboard** for monitoring
and managing **all facets of the business**, from high-level executive KPIs to IT systems
status and security posture. This unification improves situational awareness and efficiency by
reducing context-switching between tools.
2. **SSO-First Identity Integration:** Implement **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** for single
sign-on (SSO) using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and OAuth 2.0. This means user
authentication is offloaded to a trusted identity provider (Azure AD), allowing the platform to
trust **ID tokens** issued by Azure AD and avoiding any local password storage. **Entra ID**
(formerly Azure AD) becomes the central identity store, and our application will rely on its
tokens and claims for authenticating users, enforcing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**,
and obtaining user attributes/roles. This approach **eliminates password management** in
our app and aligns with **modern zero trust** practices, which put identity at the core of
security. The platform will also leverage **Azure AD groups and roles** for **RBAC** –
mapping Azure AD user/group claims to in-app roles and permissions. In line with best
practices, the solution will enforce **least-privilege access** by granting only the minimum
required permissions to each role and using the narrowest scope possible.
3. **Integration & Extensibility:** Serve as an **integration hub** for both cloud services and
on-prem systems via a modular connector framework. The system will quickly integrate new
**third-party APIs** (e.g., cloud services, SEO/marketing platforms, CRM, network devices,
etc.) via connectors that map external data into a **canonical data model**. This allows core
modules (like dashboards or reports) to consume data in a consistent format regardless of
source, making it faster to add or swap integrations without rearchitecting the core.
4. **Security & Compliance by Design:** Embed robust security controls and auditing from the
ground up (“built-in, not bolted on”). This includes **RBAC/ACL** for feature access, and
plans for **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** to incorporate contextual policies (for
example requiring MFA or certain device posture for sensitive actions). The platform will
generate **audit logs** of user actions and security events to support compliance and
monitoring. **Zero Trust Architecture** principles are embraced, meaning every request is
verified for **who** (identity), **what** (permissions/roles), and **context** (device security,
network, etc.), and sensitive operations can require re-authentication or step-up MFA. The
system will separate **policy decision** from policy enforcement – likely via a dedicated
**policy engine** microservice that evaluates fine-grained policies. Physical security
integrations (like door access systems or camera NVR alerts) will be tied into the same
identity and policy framework.
5. **Scalability & SaaS-readiness:** Architect the system as a **set of microservices**
orchestrated via Docker containers, suitable for deployment on cloud infrastructure (Azure
and/or AWS). Each service addresses a distinct domain (identity, data ingestion, UI, etc.),
enabling independent scaling and maintenance. The platform will adopt a **multi-tenant**
design, meaning multiple customer organizations can be hosted on a single deployment
securely. Tenant isolation will be ensured at every layer (data, application, and network
segmentation) such that no data or actions can cross between tenants. Tenant context will be
**extracted early** and passed along; common libraries will handle tenant-specific policy
enforcement to minimize tenant-related logic in microservice code. The data architecture will
be scalable, evolving from per-tenant transactional databases to a consolidated analytics
**data lake/lakehouse** architecture spanning cloud platforms.
6. **Hybrid Cloud Support:** Recognizing **hybrid IT environments**, the platform will operate
in the cloud while also interfacing with **on-premises and edge systems**. For example, an
“edge agent” (a lightweight Docker container or service) may be deployed on-premises to
interface with local resources (legacy servers, physical security systems, IoT devices) and
feed data back to the cloud control plane. This ensures the platform can manage **cloud
resources alongside on-premises infrastructure**, supporting use cases such as branch
offices, factories, or datacenters that require local control but centralized oversight.
7. **Modern User Experience:** Offer a **clean, responsive, and “premium” enterprise UI**
that remains intuitive for users across roles (executives, IT admins, security analysts,
business users). The interface will support **customizable dashboards** with drag-and-drop
**widget** components, enabling users to tailor their home screen to the metrics and controls
relevant to their role. The design will emphasize fast navigation (with features like global
search/command palette to quickly find data or trigger actions), role-based default views, and
a **marketplace of modular widgets** to extend functionality. Consistent UX patterns (search,
action, insight) will allow users to swiftly search for entities, take action, and view insights, all
from the unified interface.
Product Concept & Scope
What It Is
The Enterprise OS Dashboard is essentially a **central operating system for the company’s
internal workflows and data**. It provides an at-a-glance view of company health and
operations, and allows performing both high-level and low-level tasks from one interface. Key
functional **modules** (or “micro-applications”) will span multiple domains – identity and
access management, IT operations, business analytics, documentation, and security. Each
module will appear as part of the unified web interface and follow consistent design and
navigation principles. The platform aims to be **both inward-facing** (improving the
organization’s internal operations) and eventually **a product for external customers** who
want a **Business/IT operations platform** with minimal setup.
Core Features & Modules
| Module / Section | Description & Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Home (Company Health)** | **Executive dashboard** with high-level KPIs and health
metrics across the business. Displays financial metrics, operational efficiency, project status,
risk and security posture, and alerts, offering a real-time snapshot of organizational health. By
providing a **single source of truth**, executives and managers can quickly assess
performance and risk in one glance. |
| **Identity & Access** | Central hub for **user and access management**. Integrates with
**Microsoft Entra ID** for SSO and user provisioning. Features include user directory, group
and role management, access reviews, and audit logs. Enforces **least-privilege principles**
using Entra ID groups and roles mapped to in-app permissions. Supports **access requests**
and approvals and forms the foundation of a **Zero Trust** approach. |
| **Operations Hub** | Workspace for operations and administration teams. Includes user
lifecycle management (onboarding/offboarding workflows), system status dashboards, and IT
service management integrations. Users can create and track tasks or workflows – for
example, triggering a **new employee onboarding** sequence that provisions accounts,
equipment, and permissions automatically. Centralizes incident management by pulling alerts
from various monitoring tools and allowing quick assignment of incident response tasks. |
| **Security Center** | Dedicated section for **security and compliance teams**. Provides an
overview of identity protection status (e.g., MFA usage, risky sign-ins), access review
dashboards, and a unified **audit trail**. Integrates with SIEM/SOAR tools and shows alerts
from **physical security systems** (door access logs, NVR camera alerts) alongside
cybersecurity alerts. Supports **Zero Trust** decisions by visualizing identity and device trust
scores and includes controls for policy management. Role-based views ensure relevant info is
displayed per user. |
| **Documentation & Knowledge** | An internal knowledge base and runbook repository.
Provides a wiki-like interface for **company documentation**, SOPs, troubleshooting guides,
and project documentation. Integrates with existing tools (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint) for
unified search. Features full-text search, collaborative editing, and a chatbot or search
assistant to help users find information quickly. Stores network diagrams, IT architecture, and
compliance manuals. |
| **Analytics / BI Dashboards** | Aggregates data from various sources (sales, marketing,
operations) into interactive charts and reports. Example: marketing teams can view SEO
metrics from Google Search Console or Ahrefs; sales teams can see CRM and revenue
dashboards; ops teams can see project delivery timelines. Supports growth into data lakes for
advanced analysis and machine learning insights on integrated data. |
| **Network & Infrastructure** | Provides centralized view and control of network and IT
infrastructure. Integrates with network devices and cloud infrastructure:
**pfSense/OPNsense** firewalls, **Ubiquiti/UniFi** controllers, and cloud status (Azure,
GCP). Displays real-time network status, active connections, client counts, and allows push
configuration changes. Bridges cloud and on-prem infrastructure, supporting hybrid
environments. |
| **Video / NVR Surveillance** | Integrates with Network Video Recorder (NVR) systems (e.g.,
Frigate) to display camera feeds, alert on motion or recognized events, and log physical
security incidents. Ingests MQTT event feeds from Frigate to produce security alerts and tie
physical security events to identity context. Extends zero trust by connecting physical and
digital events – for example, linking a detected face to an employee’s profile or triggering
alerts if an unrecognized person is detected after hours. |
| **Admin Console** | Provides supervisory tools for system administrators, especially in a
SaaS context. Includes **tenant management** (adding new client organizations, managing
subscriptions, ensuring separation), system configuration, and monitoring of platform health
and performance. Enables global settings and debug tools for internal teams.
Each module supports **search**, **action**, and **insight** interactions across all data,
reflecting an enterprise operating model.
Target Users / Personas
• **C-Suite & Executives:** Need high-level KPIs, risk posture, and financial/operational
metrics and can quickly drill into any issues. They will primarily use the Home dashboard.
• **IT Administrators & Operators:** Require full visibility into network and IT infrastructure,
ability to manage devices, and handle user provisioning and incident tickets. They will spend
time in the Operations Hub and Network & Infrastructure modules.
• **Security & Compliance Teams:** Rely on the Security Center for identity protection status,
security alerts, access reviews, and physical security events. They need to investigate alerts
and manage policies.
• **Department Managers & Business Teams:** Use Analytics/BI dashboards to track
business metrics (sales, marketing, operations), and use the Documentation/Knowledge
module for SOPs, runbooks, and project documentation.
Role-based access ensures each persona only sees what is relevant to them, enhancing
security and minimizing clutter.
Technical Architecture & Microservices Design
Service Decomposition & Responsibilities
The architecture is microservices-based, with each service owning a distinct domain. Key
services include:
| Service | Role & Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **API Gateway** | Single entry point for all client and external API requests; handles
authentication (validates OIDC tokens), authorization, routing to underlying services, rate
limiting, and logging. Ensures consistent security enforcement and tenant context extraction
before requests hit internal services. |
| **Identity & Auth Service** | Integrates with Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication
through **OIDC/OAuth2**; handles login redirects, processes ID/JWT tokens, establishes
user sessions, and syncs user and group details from Azure AD. Exposes user info to other
services, mapping Azure AD group claims to roles. |
| **Policy/Authorization Service** | Central **Policy Engine** evaluating complex authorization
rules. Separates policy decision-making from enforcement; supports hybrid RBAC/ABAC
models so other services can ask, “Can this user perform this action on this resource given
context X?” Aligns with Zero Trust principles by incorporating contextual controls (MFA status,
device posture). |
| **Frontend/UI Service** | Serves the **Next.js** web application and static assets. Provides
the presentation layer, including the main layout, widgets, and user interactions. Connects to
the backend via the API Gateway. |
| **Widget & Layout Engine** | Manages dashboard and widget configurations, storing and
rendering user-specific layouts. Provides APIs for saving and retrieving dashboards, and may
later host a marketplace of widgets. |
| **Connector Services** | Each connects to an external service or device, handles
authentication (e.g., OAuth, API keys), periodically polls or listens to webhooks, normalizes
data into platform models, and may execute commands. Examples include connectors for
ServiceFusion, UniFi, Search Console, pfSense, OPNsense, Azure, GCP, Cloudflare,
Proxmox, and Frigate NVR. |
| **Data Services** | Host core data storage & retrieval. Start with **MongoDB** for flexibility;
over time evolve to include relational DBs, time-series stores, and data lakes/lakehouse.
Store configuration (tenants, users, roles), integration data, and event logs. Manage data
retention and partitioning for multi-tenancy. |
| **Event & Messaging Bus** | Provides asynchronous communication between services,
using technologies like Kafka, Azure Service Bus, or MQTT. Connectors publish events (e.g.,
security alerts from Frigate) and other services subscribe (e.g., Security Center service).
Supports decoupling and scalable event-driven architecture.
Key Architectural Considerations
1. **Separation of Concerns:** Each service has a narrow role; connectors and UI
components can evolve without breaking the core. Services are loosely coupled via an event
bus and API Gateway.
2. **Multi-Tenancy:** Tenant context is determined at request ingress (e.g., from the JWT
token) and passed through the system, ensuring data isolation. Shared libraries enforce
tenant scoping so developers don't manually add checks each time.
3. **Hybrid Deployment:** The architecture supports components running in cloud and
on-prem; local agents can handle tasks like interfacing with firewalls or NVRs and
communicate securely to the cloud.
4. **Scalability & Resilience:** Services run in containers (Docker), enabling horizontal
scaling. Resilient design patterns (circuit breakers, caching, retries) ensure tolerance of
external API failures.
5. **Security by Design:** Security is enforced centrally via the API Gateway and Policy
service; data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Secrets are managed via vaults, and audit
logging is built into services for compliance.
Frontend Implementation Plan (Next.js UI & User Experience)
• **Framework:** Use **Next.js** with React and TypeScript for the front-end. This allows for
server-side rendering, static site generation, and a smooth single-page app experience. The
app will be responsive and accessible.
• **Initial UI Template:** Develop a core layout with a side navigation bar for major modules, a
top bar with search and user menu, and a main content area for dashboards. Support
dark/light themes.
• **Login Experience:** Implement a modern login page. For early development, a basic
`admin/admin` login can exist, but we will integrate **SSO via Entra ID** from the start. This
means the login page mainly redirects to the Microsoft sign-in process. After authentication,
the user is redirected back with a token to our app.
• **Dashboard Home & Widgets:** Provide a default dashboard populated with a few sample
widgets. Users can add, remove, or rearrange widgets (drag-and-drop). Provide a widget
library with at least: text card, chart, KPI display, and list/table. Each widget pulls from a
standard data source via the connectors.
• **Global Navigation & Search:** Add a universal search bar (or command palette) to quickly
find users, devices, incidents, documents, etc. Provide keyboard shortcuts for improved
productivity. The search results should indicate data type (e.g., User vs Device) and allow
direct navigation.
• **User & Tenant Administration:** Create screens for viewing user details, assigning roles,
and managing organization structure. Support local user creation (if needed) while
encouraging using Entra ID for identity management. Provide an organization switcher if the
user has access to multiple tenants.
• **Responsive & Accessible Design:** Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA),
ensure proper labeling for screen readers, and responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
Offer dark/light theme toggles and clear color contrast. Use consistent components to reduce
cognitive load on users.
Backend Plan: Scaling, Data, and Entra ID Integration
• **Stack:** Use **Node.js/TypeScript** for the backend services, containerized via
**Docker**. This ensures synergy with the front-end stack and access to a broad ecosystem.
• **Database:** Start with **MongoDB** for flexible document storage, capturing user profiles,
configuration, and connectors’ data. Later, separate transactional data from large-scale logs
and analytics – using specialized stores or data lakes for growth.
• **Service Framework:** Use a modular Node.js framework (Express or NestJS) to structure
services. Services will communicate via REST through the API Gateway and
publish/subscribe via the event bus.
• **Entra ID Integration:** Implement **OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows** for
SSOn3†L14-L22n. Use the Azure AD authorization endpoint for user sign-in, exchange
authorization codes for ID tokens, and verify them using the Microsoft public keys. Extract
user claims (name, email, group memberships) to local user records. For deeper integration,
use **Microsoft Graph API** to fetch user profiles and groups, and leverage **SDKs** for
operations. Map Azure AD groups to internal roles for RBAC.
• **RBAC/ABAC:** Start with RBAC – user roles determine module access. Use hybrid
RBAC+ABAC to incorporate context (e.g., require MFA, enforce tenant scoping). Build or
integrate a **Policy Engine** to centralize evaluations of access rules. Implement multi-tenant
data isolation at the code and database layers.
• **Audit Logging:** Each service generates audit events (user logins, role change, data
access) that are stored for security and compliance.
• **Security & DevOps:** All communications are over HTTPS/TLS, secrets are managed via
Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, and services don’t share credentials. Use CI/CD
pipelines to build, test, and deploy containers with scanning for vulnerabilities. Monitor
services with cloud-native monitoring (Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch), set up alerting for
anomalies, and design fallback strategies for external API failures.
Integration Strategy for Third-Party Services and APIs
Connections to external systems are vital. We will build connectors that manage
authentication and map their data to our internal models. Highlighted services include:
| Integration | Purpose & Data | Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** | SSO and identity; user and group directory. | Use OIDC
flows for authentication and Microsoft Graph API for user/group queries and possible
provisioning. |
| **Microsoft 365 Services (Exchange, Teams, SharePoint)** | Email, chat, document
metadata; unify communications. | Use Microsoft Graph REST APIs to fetch emails, chats,
calendar events, or document metadata to enrich other modules (e.g., show related
communications on an incident page). |
| **Google Marketing Platform (Search Console, Ads, Analytics)** | SEO performance, ad
metrics, website analytics. | Use official APIs: Google Ads API for campaign metrics, Google
Search Console API for search analytics, and Google Analytics Data API for web analytics
data. Authenticate via OAuth2 service accounts or delegated user tokens. |
| **Ahrefs** | SEO backlink and keyword analytics. | Use the **Ahrefs API** (v3), which
provides endpoints for retrieving backlinks, domain rankings, keywords, etc.; authenticate via
API key or token. |
| **ServiceFusion (CRM/Field Service)** | Customer/job/estimate/invoice data for operations
and support. | Use ServiceFusion’s REST API to fetch and post job records, customers, and
invoices. Store relevant data in our integration store and display active jobs or customer info
in the Ops module. |
| **pfSense / OPNsense** | Network firewall/router status and configuration. | Use pfSense’s
REST/GraphQL API package and OPNsense’s official API to monitor status, logs, firewall
rules, and apply configuration changes. Likely runs via an on-prem edge agent for secure
connectivity. |
| **Ubiquiti UniFi** | Wi-Fi and network infrastructure monitoring. | Connect via UniFi’s Site
Manager API to retrieve access point and switch statuses, connected clients, and network
usage metrics. Provide network admins with a real-time view of network health and
configuration options. |
| **Cloud Platforms (Azure, GCP)** | Monitor and manage cloud resources. | Use Azure and
GCP APIs/SDKs to retrieve information on virtual machines, storage, and network resources.
Provide visibility of cloud resource status and costs; implement safe actions (like restarting a
VM). |
| **Physical Security & IoT (RADIUS & Frigate NVR)** | Tie physical access and surveillance
events into the dashboard. | Integrate with RADIUS servers to log and report physical access
events (door entry, Wi-Fi authentication). Use the **NPS Extension for Azure MFA** where
appropriaten49†L12-L20n. For cameras/NVR, connect to Frigate’s **MQTT event
feed**n42†L20-L28n to ingest real-time security alerts. |
These connectors will be built incrementally; the framework allows quick addition of new
services as business needs evolve.
Security Model – Zero Trust Alignment and Governance
1. **Strong Authentication:** The platform uses **SSO with Entra ID**, benefiting from Azure
AD’s security features such as MFA, passwordless sign-in, and conditional access. Each
request carries a JWT token validated by the API Gateway and Identity service, fulfilling the
identity-centric control element of Zero Trustn27†L4-L12n.
2. **Least Privilege & Segmentation:** Access control follows **RBAC** with plans for
**ABAC** to incorporate context. Users are only granted the permissions they require for their
roles, as per Microsoft’s least privilege guidancen6†L18-L26n. The system enforces data and
network isolation for each tenant, preventing lateral movement. Services operate with minimal
privileges and are segmented from each other. By integrating physical security signals (e.g.,
door access logs) into the same policy framework, physical and digital access can be
cross-correlated.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:** Security events from Azure AD (sign-in risk events, device
compliance) and other systems are collected and analyzed. Unusual patterns (e.g., failed
logins, new device logins, off-hours physical access) trigger notifications or require additional
verification (e.g., step-up MFA). This dynamic risk evaluation guides policy decisions through
the Policy engine. Security logs are stored immutably and can be shipped to a SIEM for
analysis.
4. **Audit & Governance:** All access attempts and administrative actions are logged. Audit
trails help with troubleshooting and demonstrate compliance. We will eventually integrate with
compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC 2) and follow best practices in data retention and privacy
regulation compliance (GDPR, etc.). Plans include twonperson approval for critical actions
and integration with identity lifecycle management (e.g., revoking access automatically when
a user leaves or fails an access review).
Roadmap: From MVP to V2 and Beyond
The roadmap outlines incremental phases to deliver value early and build progressively:
1. **Phase 0 – Foundations & Architecture (Month 0n3):** Define data models, APIs, and
service boundaries. Initialize the codebases (front and back ends). Set up Docker containers,
orchestrators, and CI/CD pipelines. Finalize the integration approach for Entra ID and initial
microservices.
2. **Phase 1 – Identity & UI Shell (Month 3n6):** Implement Entra ID SSO integration with a
basic admin console. Build the core Next.js layout with navigation and placeholder pages. Set
up RBAC and show/hide modules based on user roles.
3. **Phase 2 – MVP Integrations & Dashboard (Month 4n9):** Develop the dashboard and
widget engine. Implement a small set of widgets (charts, tables, text). Create connectors for
three “hero” services: **ServiceFusion** (CRM/Ops), **UniFi** (network), and **Google
Search Console** (SEO analytics). Implement basic tasks/operations management and a
rudimentary Security page to capture sign-in logs or simple events. Provide an initial auditing
interface. Enable local Docker deployment for testing.
4. **Phase 3 – Hardening & Expanded Functionality (Month 6n12):** Perform security
reviews and enhance protections (input validation, circuit breakers, encryption, etc.). Expand
existing integrations with more endpoints and add new ones (e.g., Azure Monitor,
pfSense/OPNsense advanced features, Cloudflare). Build data ingestion pipelines for event
logs via an event bus. Refine UI/UX based on feedback: more widgets, improved navigation,
better theming. Add a basic help system and documentation. Conduct user acceptance
testing.
5. **Phase 4 – Multi-Tenancy & SaaS Launch (Month 9n15):** Introduce multintenant
support (tenant-specific context, tenant admin roles). Provide tenant provisioning workflows
and possibly billing/subscription integration. Validate isolation, perform performance and scale
tests. Launch V1 to pilot customers as a SaaS. Begin to gather customer feedback.
6. **Phase 5 – V2 Development (Month 16+):** Expand the platform with advanced
capabilities: incorporate a full data lakehouse for analytics, develop a **password safe/secret
management** module, implement more advanced ABAC policies (possibly leveraging OPA
or thirdnparty services), build visual workflow automation for IT/business processes, deepen
IoT/physical security integrations, consider a thirdnparty extension marketplace, and refine
the UX/UI based on real-world usage. Mature the security posture with context-aware access
controls and integrate deeper with SIEM/SOAR for threat response.
Data Platform Strategy – From Product DB to Lakehouse
1. **Initial Stage:** Use **MongoDB** to store core product data (users, tenants, roles, widget
layouts) and small volumes of recent data pulled from connectors. Use this for the MVP’s
real-time dashboard display.
2. **Intermediate Stage:** As data volume increases (logs, metrics), introduce specialized
stores. For example, Elastic or time-series databases for logs and performance metrics, and a
relational DB for structured business data if necessary. Begin exporting data to object storage
(cloud buckets) for archive.
3. **Lakehouse Evolution:** For long-term scalability and advanced analytics, create a **data
lake/lakehouse architecture** on cloud platforms (Azure Data Lake on top of ADLS +
Synapse, or AWS S3 + Athena). Use streaming or batch pipelines (via Apache Kafka, Azure
Event Hubs, or AWS Kinesis) to ingest data from connectors and services into the lake. Use
Spark or SQL engines to process data, enabling machine learning models and crossndomain
analytics. Keep metadata about data lineage and partitioning to maintain multintenant
isolation within the lake. Provide an analytics API on top of the lake for the platform’s
Analytics/BI module.
Design & User Experience Requirements
• **Modern, Clean UI:** Build a professional interface with intuitive navigation. Use a modern
design system (Material UI, Fluent UI, or custom) with consistent color palette and
typography. Offer dark/light mode and tenant branding options.
• **Responsiveness & Accessibility:** Optimize for desktop and mobile devices. Follow
WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines: sufficient contrast, screen-reader labels, keyboard navigation, etc.
• **Customization:** Allow users to personalize dashboards with configurable widgets;
provide a widget library and drag-and-drop layout changes. Save personalized configs per
user and provide default templates per role.
• **Global Search & Quick Actions:** Provide a universal search/command bar to find users,
devices, tickets, documents, or functions quickly. Include keyboard shortcuts for power users.
• **Contextual Navigation & Drill-Down:** Let users drill into details from high-level
dashboards. Ex: clicking a network alert opens the network device page with logs, and a user
record page shows identity, roles, and audit trails. Support direct actions (approve, close, edit)
from within context.
• **Notifications & Alerts:** Present a consolidated notification center for critical alerts
(security, tasks, requests). Real-time updates via websockets ensure users see alerts
promptly. Provide filtering by severity and category.
• **Guided Onboarding & Help:** Offer step-by-step setup guides and in-context help
messages. Maintain comprehensive documentation and runbooks accessible in the platform.
Consider an AI-powered help bot for quick questions.
